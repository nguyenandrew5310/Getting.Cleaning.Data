# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is Andrew Nguyen's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Course 3: Getting And Cleaning Data, from Data Science Specialization, by Johns Hopkins University, on coursera

The course is taught by:

-Jeff Leek, Phd
- Roger D. Peng, Phd
- Brian Caffo, Phd

Main script, 'run_analysis.R' the requirements was that it should be able to run, as far as the 'UCI HAR Dataset' is present in the working directory and to be able to perform the following 5 steps:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# Details on the files that exist in this repository

- codeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

- run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition:

     - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
     
     
 - req_data.txt is the final data after going through all the sequences described above.
